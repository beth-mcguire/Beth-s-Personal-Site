            <h2>Beth McGuire - About Me</h2>
            <p class="intro">I'm graduating University May 12, 2023 and made the Dean's list, hooray! In school, I took
                quite a
                few programming classes where I learned Python, SQL, and the HTML/CSS/JS trinity. I love
                making visions come to life and as a result, front-end is my primary passion, but I also don't mind
                back-end. I did projects in class, on my own, and have taken various classes through Udemy the past 3
                years.
            </p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, I also enjoys games, exploring Colorado, anime, travel, and reading fantasy. I've
                been
                to 48 states and
                will be in Japan for a month in May! This... will clearly be edited after May!</p>

                <h3>Front-end Development</h3>
                <p>I'm <em>very</em> confident in HTML/CSS/JS. I enjoy working with flexbox the most, but can also
                    confidently use Grid and Bootstrap. For JS, I am comfortable with both vanilla JS as well as React.
                    I believe it's nice knowing how the basic language works before diving into a framework so if a bug
                    arises, it's easier to solve. I led a school project where we had to make a restaurant site using
                    HTML/CSS, and as you'll find below, several of my own projects as well as projects from other
                    courses. I also have experience with APIs.
                </p>

                <h3>Back-end Development</h3>
                <p>Through University, I took quite a few courses where I learned beginner and intermediate Python, PHP,
                    and SQL. I've made a couple projects with Codeigniter and PHP and have also learned through Udemy
                    how to incorporate Node.JS, MongoDB, and Mongoose into working projects!</p>
