            <h2>Beth McGuire - About Me</h2>
            <p class="intro">I am a recent graduate as of May 12, 2023 and graduated Magna Cum Laude, hooray! In school, I took
                quite a
                few programming classes where I learned Python, SQL, and the HTML/CSS/JS trinity. I love
                making visions come to life and as a result, front-end is my primary passion, but I also don't mind
                back-end or data analysis. I did projects in class, on my own, and have taken various classes through Udemy the past 3
                years.
            </p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, I also enjoys games, exploring Colorado, anime, travel, and reading fantasy. I've
                been
                to 48 states and
                just got back from a trip to Japan end of May!</p>

                <h3>Front-end Development</h3>
                <p>I'm <em>very</em> confident in HTML/CSS/JS. I enjoy working with flexbox the most, but can also
                    confidently use Grid and Bootstrap. For JS, I am comfortable with both vanilla JS as well as React.
                    I believe it's nice knowing how the basic language works before diving into a framework so if a bug
                    arises, it's easier to solve. I led a school project where we had to make a restaurant site using
                    HTML/CSS, and as you'll find below, several of my own projects as well as projects from other
                    courses. I also have experience with APIs.
                </p>

                <h3>Back-end Development</h3>
                <p>Through University, I took quite a few courses where I learned beginner and intermediate Python,
                    and SQL. I've learned through Udemy
                    how to incorporate Node.JS, MongoDB, and Mongoose into working projects and am currently doing my
                    best to learn PHP!</p>

                    <a href="https://jovial-banoffee-ecdd03.netlify.app/" target="_blank">React Hangman</a>
                    <p>Coded in React, user clicks on letters to make a guess and after enough guesses, you lose and
                        have to try again. Will eventually work to implement keyboard input as well.</p>

                    <p>Made using HTML/CSS and only using JS for the gradient, this huge site required a lot of
                        different techniques including grid, flexbox, responsive design, and common layouts for footers.

                    <p>This project utilized HTML/CSS and JS to create a game similar to what we played as children. You
                        memorize the patterns and when you finally can't remember, the game is over and clicking any
                        key, you can play again. A <em>lot</em> of JS functions and event listeners were utilized in
                        this project.</p>

                    <a href="https://cute-todos.netlify.app/" target="_blank">To Do List Project</a>
                    <p>This project utilized HTML/CSS/JS and JSON. To Do items are stored to your computers memory and
                        has filters to filter through your list, as well as check off the boxes and hide those you
                        completed. Deleting is also an option too! Although more simplistic than the others, this was
                        one of my favorites to work on.</p>

                    <a href="https://distracted-sammet-227306.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Gotta Catch 'em All</a>
                    <p>A basic React project making cards that contain Pokemon sprites. Utilized front-end development
                        inside of React to make a clean looking project. Eventually will update to have even more
                        Pokemon and a flipping effect that displays more information.</p>

                    <a href="https://beth-budget-app.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Budgeting Project</a>
                    <p>Another front-end project (can you see my passions?!) that uses HTML/CSS/JS/JSON since memory is
                        stored on your computer. Inputs are used for adding description to income and expenses, and you
                        can pick which one to use. You then hit the button which adds it, does the math, and shows your
                        available budget up top. Income is green and expenses are red. This was one of my earliest
                        projects.</p>
